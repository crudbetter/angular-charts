angular-charts
================

Native AngularJS SVG chart directives with no other dependencies. Heavily inspired by the AngularJS [bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap) directives. The aim is to avoid large secondary downloads alongside AngularJS (such as D3 or HighCharts) and the inevitable integration headaches.

## Demo

Please visit [http://crudbetter.github.io/angular-charts/](http://crudbetter.github.io/angular-charts/) to see the directives in action.

## Installation

You can download all versions from the [gh-pages](http:/github.com/crudbetter/angular-charts/tree/gh-pages) branch.

Once downloaded simply add dependencies to the AngularJS modules you require.

	angular.module('myAppModule', ['piechart', 'linechart']);
